A TurboGears 2 inspired full stack framework for Node.js written in CoffeeScript.

The goals of this project are to include the following features:

	- url routing by traversing property graph (mostly implemented).
	- extendable, yet easy, server configuration using subclassing (started).
	- pluggable mechanisms for authentication, sessions, caching, etc.
	- embedded i18n both in the client side scripts and on the server side.
	- integrated templating with full support for promises.
	- extensive debugging support.

Requirements:

	- Express framework  (http://expressjs.com/)
	- CoffeeScript 1.0 (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
